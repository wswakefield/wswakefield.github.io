        “. . . the performers look lonely. . .”
        <br><br>
           Fundamentally, <i>untitled 2018 (colors, actions)</i> is a meditation on the meeting of two forces. The first is an effort to transcode a musical logic onto other logics, to invent new meaning by mixing up codes; It asks, what new meaning might the space of, for example, gesture offer if the relations between gestures were determined by a musical logic? The second force is the principle of arbitrariness, which operates ultimately to neutralize the new meaning generated via the first process; the arbitrariness casts the meaningful realtions as mere coincidence. The end result of the meeting of these two forces is something like emptiness, or immobility, which explains why "untitled 2018" might seem to emit a sense of boredom.
        <br><br>
        At this point, I will go into more detail about the exact processes of the two forces at play here -- to illustrate them -- while keeping the above points in mind.
         <br><br>
           The source material that we begin with is the well-known melody of the<i>Dies irae</i>. To begin the process of transcoding, we interpret our source material -- the melody of the <i>Dies irae</i> -- as a code. The melody read as a code happens to yield a set of relations between pitches. We then transcode these pitch-relations onto the space of color and of gesture (for the sake of simplicity, I'm omitting the interesting fact that the pitch-relations are additionally mapped back onto musical space, onto a two unique systems of sonic relations). Here is where things get strange. Now, we've arrived a set of colors and of gestures whose internal relationships are determined by the logic of a melody.
        <br><br>
          The force of aleatory operates within the something like the mise en scene of <i>untitled 2018</i>. Each of the five performers, seated at a table in the darkness, happens to have a laptop computer in front of them. The performers stare into the screen, which, in return, illuminates their upper bodies with a color that, in turn, makes them visible to the audience. Here is a key: the rhythm of the changing colors happens to be determined by an aleatoric algorithm, which is unsynchronized across the performers. The onsets of gestures and sounds are cued by the colors, with which they share a one-to-one correspondence. We are left with a cloud of arbitrary counterpoint: colors, sounds, and rhythms, regularly irregular, shield the performance from intelligibility.
         <br><br>
           To begin to put these ideas together, we could ask: what is the puzzle here? What does <i>untitled 2018</i> represent? There is an attempt to invent new meaning by mixing codes. Yet, we’re unsynchronized, and, therefore, the any new meaning becomes clouded. The fact that we are unsynchronized is by design: our movements are determined an algorithm, which we strictly follow. The algorithm operates to enforce the inaccessibility of any meaning we could gain from the invention of new forms.
