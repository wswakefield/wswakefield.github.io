        In its elementary form, Xenolith consists of two enormous voices rotating in discontinuous steps around an axis of musical parameters. Its structural divisions are broken apart by abrupt changes, yet these moments change together and at regular divisions, conducted via an analogy to clock time. At each new section, the voices trade off embodying two temporal states that are uniquely different from clock time: one drones on heavily, frozen in a glacial sense of motionlessness, while the other weaves hypnotic patterns by repeating fragments of scales. Each of these two massive voices comprises a group of unsynchronized individuals, in other words, although the individuals in each group are playing independently, they blend into a single massive voice. 
        Framed as a question, this work asks: how do I anchor myself in space if my structural divisions are out of joint? How do my moments cohere into a totality if their temporalities are different than that of the whole system?
